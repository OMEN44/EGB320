### Some changes are applied to the original library by 'Geir Istad' ###
### The changes aim to enhance the results of *roll-pitch-yaw* and *linear acceleration* ###
### Some changes are made for the ease of use ###
### You need to install 'Scipy library' which is used in 'DMP_get_roll_pitch_yaw' function. The former function was not accurate and was giving improper results ###
